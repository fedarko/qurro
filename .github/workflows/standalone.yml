    # ubuntu-latest doesn't support python 3.6 -- see
    # https://github.com/actions/setup-python/issues/544. Ideally we'd do
    # something fancy to test on ubuntu-latest for all python versions > 3.6
    # (and then test on ubuntu-20.04 for just python 3.6), but this is the path
    # of least resistance.
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9]

      - name: Lint and stylecheck (including using Black to check Python code)
        run: make stylecheck

      # NOTE: For now, we only submit coverage reports from the QIIME 2 CI,
      # since the tests that that CI runs are a superset of those ran by this
      # "standalone" CI. (Also, Codecov wasn't merging them, which caused
      # coverage to be underreported.)
